There are 2 folder, server and client.

For the server side :
1. Use cmd line and navigate to the folder, type in cmd line "npm install" to install all the required module.
2. Use nodejs to run the server folder by using cmd line  "node server.js"

For the client side :
1. Just put the client folder in either ruby or xamp and run it directly by loading the index.html
